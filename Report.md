#### General Observation
- CPU Load and RAM Usage of Server is directly proportional to the number of Users on a particular day.
- On a working day the average number of users of academic services like insite and webopac is higher in comparison to a holiday.

---
#### Server Specific Observations
##### students.iitmandi.ac.in
- The User load is significantly higher for 10-11 pm and 12-2 am. Most students don't sleep very early in the night, and they prefer to check their webmail before going to sleep. This might be the reason for the trend in graph.
- CPU load also showing the similar graph because more cpu power is needed to handle large users. This trend remain same on working as well as on holidays.
- RAM Usage does not show any regular trend and can be assumed to behave in an independent manner. This may happen because no user has perform any task leading to higher usage of RAM. 
- The ping time is also large for these intervals, verifying the higher correlation of ping time with CPU load and User load.
- Comparing user load of different days, number of users connecting is as high as 400 at around 2 pm on Thursday, while it is as low as 40 around the same time on Sunday indicating that Sunday being a holiday the time i.e. 2 pm is a prime time to have lunch and hence the low traffic.

##### insite.iitmandi.ac.in
- User load on each day is almost similar except for Sunday for which it is a bit less, indicating that people often check insite services.
- CPU load following the same trend as that of User Load.
- Ping time doesn't follow any particular trend.

##### network.iitmandi.ac.in
- User load on network is low as compared to insite or student servers
- The RAM Usage on network server is almost constant throughout the time and doesn't change on any day at any time.
- On thursday at around 11:00 am, when there is a peak in ping time of all services of iitmandi, the ping of network service goes critical to 5,000 ms indicating some sort of network failure as there are no huge differences visible in user load at that time.
- CPU load follow the same trend as that of User Load.

##### webopac.iitmandi.ac.in
- Ping did not seem to follow any trend and there is insufficient data to correlate other factors.
- Data of CPU usage, RAM usage and User load could not be recieved.
